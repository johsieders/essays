## The Battle of Bosworth &ndash; a Day-By-Day Account


*Johannes Siedersleben, Oxford, July 2014*

The Battle of Bosworth marked the end of Richard III, the end of the Plantagenet dynasty and the beginning of the Tudors. Three weeks from Henry’s landing till the battle changed the course of English
history. Our knowledge is mainly based on two sources: the Croyland Chronicle and the Anglia Historica. The
Croyland Chronicle covers the period from 655 to 1486. The part that describes the years 1459 till
1486 was written as early as April 1486 by an anonymous writer. The Anglia Historica was written by
Polydor Vergil (1470 – 1555), an Italian scholar, historian, priest and diplomat. It first appeared in
1513, covering events until that date.

The Battle of Bosworth is the historical background of Act V of Shakespeare’s play on Richard III. We
will present the events in chronological order and explain when and how Shakespeare comes in.

### The March
Henry Tudor, the Earl of Richmond, landed at Milford Haven at sunset on Sunday 7
th August 1485 accompanied by a small army consisting mainly of 2000 French convicts lured by the promise of a free
pardon. Henry’s captains included Jasper Tudor, the Earl of Oxford and some participants of Buckingham’s unsuccessful rebellion. In his final speech to his army (Scene iii), Richard refers to them as “a
sort of vagabonds, rascals, runaways, a scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants”. Henry marched
towards Nottingham where Richard was. The towns Henry came through were happy to open their
gates, towns Richard had been at pains to insure. Henry was also joined by the Welsh captain Rhys ap
Thomas and by Sir George Talbot followed by 500 Shropshire men.

Richard knew about Henry’s landing four days later, on *Thursday 11th August*, being correctly 
reported that Henry’s army was pitifully small and ill-equipped. As he was also unaware of the Welsh
captain’s treason, he completely underestimated the danger.

It was only on *Monday 15th August* that Richard learnt what was really going on. He was “sore moved
and broiled with melancholy” (Vergil) about the defection of his Welsh alleys. A total of 3000 additional troops had joined Henry. On the other side, Richard’s captains were Northumberland, Norfolk,
Surrey, Lovell, Brackenbury and Stanley. Lord Thomas Stanley was Yorkist and, at the same time,
Henry’s stepfather. Lord Thomas and his brother, Sir William, were supposed to fight for the King,
and to make sure they did, Richard held Lord Strange, Thomas’ son, a hostage.

On *Wednesday 17th August*, Sir William Stanley met Henry secretly. They discussed how they could
cooperate during the battle, but their plans were vague and no concrete decisions were taken. This
corresponds roughly to Scene iii when Henry, the Earl of Richmond receives a comforting and encouraging letter from his stepfather Stanley. The same day, two messengers arrived in Nottingham to
cast doubts on Northumberland too. There is an allusion to this defection in Scene iii, when Richard
asks Ratcliff if he saw “the melancholy Northumberland”.

On *Thursday 18th August*, messengers reported to Richard that the Lancastrian army had changed
their direction. Henry now headed towards Atherstone, where Lord Stanley lay, which lets us assume
that there probably was at least some vague intention to cooperate.

On *Friday 19th August*, the royal army took the road for Leicester with Henry looking “truculent”.
About 10,000 men were collected on behalf of one single person, the King. The same evening, Henry
paused at the roadside, accompanied by a bodyguard of twenty men and expecting to join his army
soon. But he effectively lost his troops and spent a sleepless night straying around and fearing to be
spotted by the enemy.

The morning of *Saturday 20th August*, Henry was reunited with his army and was thus able to have
another secret meeting, this time with Lord Thomas Stanley, William’s brother. Again, the outcome is
not clear, apparently because Stanley was delaying his decision until the very last moment. Shakespeare sees it more optimistically, letting Stanley (also called Earl of Derby) say to Henry in Scene iii:
“But on thy side I may not be too forward lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George, be executed
in his father’s sight”. Stanley withdrew his troops to Stoke Golding near Market Bosworth, about 30
miles south of Nottingham and north of Redmore Plain. The exact location of the battle is still debated: no convincing evidence of a former battlefield such as cannon balls, swords or skeletons has
been found.

The *21st August* being a Sunday, a battle could only be prepared, not fought. Richard placed his
troops near Sutton Cheney, at the eastern end of a ridge and in visual contact with both Stanleys. At
first sight, his position wasn’t too bad: His captains were finally assembled, and the location on the
ridge was favourable. But the chronicles unanimously attribute a sleepless night to Richard. In Scene
iii, Richard’s night is not only sleepless but haunted by the ghosts of Richard’s eleven victims: from
Prince Edward, son of Henry VI, to Buckingham. When Richard starts out of his dream, he is in black
despair: “Have mercy Jesus!” he laments and then goes on to a painful self-analysis. On the other
side, Henry, who had already had his share of bad nights, “has slept the sweetest sleep” and has had
“the fairest-boding dreams that ever entered in a drowsy head”.

### The Battle
The next morning, the morning of *Monday 22nd August*, Richard sent a last message to Lord Stanley,
asking him to declare for the King now, “lest his son George fall into the blind cave of eternal night”
as is said in Scene iii. But Stanley “doth deny to come”, and Richard wasn’t able to carry out his
threat, because “the enemy is past the march”. Stanley, who had received a similar, however nonblackmailing request from Henry, 
refused a second time, a fact Shakespeare doesn’t mention. Unsurprisingly, Henry was “no little vexed” as Vergil put it.

The battle started with a shower of arrows sent by Norfolk’s bowmen on Oxford’s close-packed formation, 
who wavered but didn’t break. And then the Yorkists gave ground, Norfolk was killed, but
Northumberland refused to fill the gap because he had no intention of risking his head. Richard
didn’t give up: Henry’s red dragon banner had been spotted less than a mile off; the battle would be
won if Henry was killed.

Richard rode forward and was able to slay Sir William Bandon, Richmond’s standard bearer and to
unhorse the huge Sir John Cheyney. But then, Sir William’s horsemen were colliding with the rear of
Richard’s force. The King was overwhelmed, pulled to the ground and had the rear of his head cut
off. Scene iv and the stage direction of Scene v give an abridged report of these events, Shakespeare
having Henry (Richmond) himself fighting victoriously against Richard. And that was the end of the
Battle of Bosworth.
