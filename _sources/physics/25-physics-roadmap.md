# Physics Roadmap

This presentation takes you on a journey from Greek physics to general relativity. 
I have attempted to capture some of the key ideas and explain the steps required to progress from one level to the next.
It's my answer to the question: What is modern physics all about?
No torches and no superfast trains, but clean ideas you can talk about over a pint or two.
