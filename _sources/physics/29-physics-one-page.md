# Modern Physics: One-Pager


This is a sketch of the mathematics behind the [Physics Roadmap](25-physics-roadmap.md).
Sorry for the poor handwriting.
A clean version is on my to-do list. The figure shows four quadrants: Newtonian mechanics (N, top left);
special relativity (SR, bottom left), quantum mechanics (QM, top right), and quantum field theory (QFT, bottom left).
The overarching principle is that of least action, famously presented in Chapter 19 of {cite}`feynman1963vol2`,
The backbone of the story is the equations of motion in several 
flavours (Newton, Hamilton, Schrödinger, Einstein, Klein–Gordon, and Dirac).
I'll put that sheet on my gravestone.
