# Bagatelles

These are papers I wrote over the last few years,
some in Oxford ([OUSSA](https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/about/oussa)),
some in Paris, some at home and all for my own pleasure.
Enjoy, agree or disagree! 
Why 'Bagatelles'? It works in three languages and shows that I don't take myself too seriously.

I am a committed, shameless, and unrepentant user of AI, and
I feel like a farmer in the 1950s, trying his first harvester.
Here is my claim: AI is not a replacement for thought but an accelerator of it.
Thanks to Claude Code, this website was put together in just a few hours, starting from a broken, plain-vanilla site and a heap of Markdown files.
The introduction to [First Steps in Arithmetic](mathematics/arithmetic.md) was generated by GPT.
I could have written a similar text, but not in two seconds.
[Medieval Philosophy *](philosophy/34-medieval-philosophy.md) is a summary of a conversation with Claude.
It condenses my view of the subject and is useful when
read alongside other sources such as {cite:t}`russell2004history` and {cite:t}`adamson2014medieval`. In [A Dialogue on Free Will *](philosophy/36-free-will.md) 
I defend my view against Claude’s objections, as I do in [What Exists in Mathematics? *](philosophy/mathematics-existence.md) 
If you ask Claude to challenge you, it will probably give you more than you asked for. 
I need a rest after two hours of objection–response exchange, but I accomplish in days what would otherwise have taken weeks or months.
I do not claim authorship of the papers marked with `*`; they express, however, 
exactly what I want to say — often better than I could have said it myself.

A lot can be held against AI: the intellectual-property issue (a challenge for legislators), 
the energy footprint (but many AI providers are committed to renewable sources), 
the job market (how can the value added by AI be distributed fairly?), 
the singularity issue (to be taken seriously?) — to name just a few.
Despite these concerns, AI can contribute greatly to solving our problems and making life more worthwhile. 
Yet it can also be misused to lead the world into disaster. It all depends on who wields the power.
Given the crowds that seem to have lost their marbles, I am only mildly optimistic.
Or have I lost mine? You decide.
