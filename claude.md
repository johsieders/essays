## Technical Architecture (v0.7)

### Deployment

**Live Site**: https://jsiedersleben.de/
**GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/johsieders/essays
**Deployment**: GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages
**SSL**: Let's Encrypt (automatic via GitHub Pages)

### Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

```yaml
name: Deploy Bagatelles

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'bagatelles/**'
      - '.github/workflows/deploy.yml'

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Checkout repository
      - Set up Python 3.10
      - Install dependencies from bagatelles/requirements.txt
      - Build Jupyter Book (jupyter-book build bagatelles/)
      - Deploy to GitHub Pages (peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3)
```

**Simple, clean, works perfectly.**

### Domain Configuration

**DNS (IONOS)**:
```
# Apex domain
@    A    185.199.108.153
@    A    185.199.109.153
@    A    185.199.110.153
@    A    185.199.111.153

# www subdomain (using A records - IONOS limitation)
www  A    185.199.108.153
www  A    185.199.109.153
www  A    185.199.110.153
www  A    185.199.111.153
```

**GitHub Pages Configuration**:
- Custom domain: `jsiedersleben.de` (apex domain)
- HTTPS enforced: Yes ✅
- Certificate: Let's Encrypt (auto-issued)

**Note**: `www.jsiedersleben.de` uses A records instead of recommended CNAME due to IONOS interface limitations. GitHub shows a warning but site works. Contact IONOS support to convert to CNAME if desired.

### Jupyter Book Configuration

**Key features enabled** (`bagatelles/_config.yml`):
- `home_page_in_toc: true` → Intro appears at top of sidebar
- `show_prev_next: true` → Navigation buttons on each page
- `navigation_with_keys: true` → Arrow key navigation
- `use_repository_button: true` → Link to GitHub repo
- `use_issues_button: true` → Link to GitHub issues
- `use_edit_page_button: true` → Edit on GitHub links

---

## What Works (v0.7)

✅ **Single build system** - No Jekyll/Jupyter conflicts
✅ **HTTPS with custom domain** - SSL certificate issued
✅ **Clean navigation** - Home button, prev/next, keyboard shortcuts
✅ **Search functionality** - Built-in Jupyter Book search
✅ **Responsive design** - Mobile-friendly
✅ **GitHub integration** - Edit links, issue reporting
✅ **Professional appearance** - sphinx_book_theme
✅ **Multilingual content** - English, German, French essays
✅ **Mathematics section** - Formal content added
✅ **SSH authentication** - Secure push/pull operations

---

## Problems Solved in v0.7

### 1. Jekyll/Jupyter Book Conflict ✅ SOLVED
**Problem**: `.nojekyll` file created by Jupyter Book broke Jekyll processing, causing 404 errors on main site.

**Solution**: Eliminated Jekyll entirely. Migrated everything to unified Jupyter Book.

### 2. Workflow Trigger Issues ✅ SOLVED
**Problem**: Changes to `content/` didn't trigger deployments.

**Solution**: New workflow only watches `bagatelles/`, simple and reliable.

### 3. SSH Authentication ✅ SOLVED
**Problem**: Personal Access Token (PAT) lacked `workflow` scope, preventing workflow commits.

**Solution**: Generated SSH key, added to GitHub, switched remote to SSH.

### 4. HTTPS/Domain Issues ✅ SOLVED
**Problem**: `www.jsiedersleben.de` showed SSL errors, site marked unsafe.

**Solution**:
- Configured apex domain (`jsiedersleben.de`) in GitHub Pages
- Let's Encrypt issued valid SSL certificate
- Site now secure with HTTPS

### 5. Navigation Issues ✅ SOLVED
**Problem**: No obvious way to return to home page.

**Solution**:
- Enabled `home_page_in_toc` to show intro in sidebar
- Added `show_prev_next` for navigation buttons
- Book title "Bagatelles" is clickable home link

## Content Highlights

### Flagship Essay: "What Exists in Mathematics?"

**Location**: `bagatelles/philosophy/mathematics_existence.md`
**Size**: 67KB (~13,000 lines)
**Genre**: Philosophy of mathematics
**Position**: Anti-Platonist formalism
**Methodology**: Developed from 3 dialogue sessions with Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Key Arguments**:
- Mathematics as formal symbol manipulation
- "Chess analogy": Numbers exist like chess strategies exist
- Darwinian selection explains "unreasonable effectiveness"
- Formalization success (Coq, Lean, Isabelle) supports formalism
- Einstein: "As far as mathematics refers to reality, it is not certain"

**Intellectual Context**:
- Aligned with: Hilbert, Field, Wittgenstein
- Against: Gödel, Penrose, Connes

**Publication Quality**: Suitable for *Philosophia Mathematica*, *Erkenntnis*

### New in v0.7: Arithmetic Content

**Location**: `bagatelles/mathematics/arithmetic/`
**Source**: https://github.com/johsieders/mypapers/arithmetic
**Content**: Formal mathematics with proofs
**Topics**:
- Introduction to arithmetic concepts
- Euclid's Algorithm (two-part treatment)

**Significance**: Establishes formal mathematics section, distinguishing rigorous proofs from philosophical essays.

### Recurring Themes

1. **Anti-dogmatism**: Skepticism toward absolute truths
2. **Compatibilism**: Reconciling determinism with agency
3. **Formalism over Platonism**: Mathematics as construction, not discovery
4. **Consequentialist ethics**: Focus on outcomes vs retribution
5. **Historical consciousness**: Ideas understood through evolution
6. **Interdisciplinary**: Philosophy meets physics, math, literature, history

---

## Future Roadmap

### Short Term (Ready to Implement)

1. **Clean up archives** (when verified safe):
   ```bash
   git rm -r content/ philosophy/ index.md _config.yml .github/workflows/deploy-book.yml
   ```

2. **Fix www CNAME** (via IONOS support):
   - Contact IONOS to manually create `www CNAME johsieders.github.io`
   - Removes GitHub warning about A records

3. **Add more mathematics**:
   - Structure ready: `bagatelles/mathematics/{arithmetic,geometry,algebra,...}/`
   - Just copy files and update `_toc.yml`

### Long Term (Potential)

1. **Rename repository**: `essays` → `bagatelles`
   - Update GitHub repo name
   - Update workflow `repository.url` in `_config.yml`

2. **PDF generation**: Enable PDF export for individual essays or entire book

3. **Cross-references**: Link related essays (e.g., free will ↔ determinism)

4. **Publication dates**: Add visible dates to essays (not just file metadata)

5. **Discussion forum**: Comments or discussion space for readers

6. **Analytics**: Track popular essays, search queries

## Technical Decisions

### Why Apex Domain Instead of www?

**Attempted**: CNAME for `www` pointing to `johsieders.github.io`
**Problem**: IONOS web interface rejects CNAME creation for www subdomain
**Workaround**: Use apex domain (`jsiedersleben.de`) with A records
**Status**: Works perfectly, minor GitHub warning (cosmetic only)
**Future**: Contact IONOS support to manually create CNAME

### Why Single Jupyter Book?

**Alternative considered**: Separate books for informal essays vs formal mathematics
**Decision**: Single book with topic-based organization
**Rationale**:
- Simpler workflow (one build, one deployment)
- Better discoverability (all content in one navigation)
- Can still distinguish informal/formal by section
- Easier to maintain

**Flexibility**: Structure supports future separation if needed:
```
# Current: One book, multiple sections
bagatelles/ → philosophy/, mathematics/, history/...

# Future option: Multiple books
essays/
├── informal/ (Jupyter Book)
├── formal/   (Jupyter Book)
└── index.html (landing page)
```

### Why Jupyter Book Over Jekyll?

**Advantages**:
- Built-in search
- Better navigation (sidebar, prev/next)
- Support for mathematical notation (LaTeX)
- Support for executable code (if needed later)
- Professional academic appearance
- Single build system (no conflicts)

**Trade-off**: Less flexibility than Jekyll, but better for academic content.
