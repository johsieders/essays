# Physics Roadmap

This presentation takes you on a journey from Greek physics to general relativity. 
I have attempted to capture some of the key ideas and explain the steps required to progress from one level to the next.
It's my answer to the question: What is modern physics all about?
I dislike torches and superfast trains, and I embrace clean ideas, even if they are abstract.
