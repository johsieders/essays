# Modern Physics: One-Pager


This is a sketch of the mathematics behind the [Physics Roadmap](physics/25-physics-roadmap.md). 
Sorry for the poor handwriting. 
A clean version is on my to-do list. There are four quadrants. The figure shows: Newtonian mechanics (top left);
Special relativity (bottom left), quantum mechanics (top right), and quantum field theory (bottom left). 
The overarching principle is that of least action, famously presented in Chapter 19 of {cite}`feynman1963vol12`,
The backbone of the story is the equations of motion in several 
varieties (Newton, Hamilton, Schrödinger, Einstein, Klein–Gordon and Dirac).
I'll put that sheet on my gravestone.
