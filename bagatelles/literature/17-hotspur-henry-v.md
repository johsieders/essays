# Hotspur and Harry: Two Sharks in a Pool

*Johannes Siedersleben, Oxford, June 2022*

At the time of Shakespeare’s kings, England, Wales, Scotland, and France were
each divided into competing camps, ruled by powerful clans, no one trusting
each other, families and individuals forming different coalitions within and across
boundaries, and quick to rebel against whoever happened to be king. Ireland was
an English nearshore colony, to be occasionally reined in. Disloyalty and inequity
were frequent, few if any rules of the game observed, unimaginable cruelties
exerted. Each family, each individual acted for their own profit.
(Has anything changed? the rash reader could ask.)

Two stand out in that pool of sharks: Henry V, the most successful of the
Lancastrian kings, born in 1386, called Henry of Monmouth, Harry, or Hal before
his accession, and Henry Percy, born in 1364, the eldest son of Henry Percy, 1st
earl of Northumberland, dubbed Hotspur for his frightening performance on the
battlefield. They stand out for their courage, their military prowess, the charisma
they must have had, and their political and military success. There were others in
the same league, such as the Black Prince, father of Richard II, or Lord Talbot,
antagonist of Joan of Arc. But let us focus on Hotspur and Harry.

### Fact and Fiction
Prior to that we have to make clear what we are dealing with: There are the
historical facts we know today, over 600 years later. Then, there are the facts
known to Shakespeare who drew much of his wisdom from the Tudor chroniclers
Hall and Holinshed. There are, finally, the plays Shakespeare kneaded from the
material available. In Shakespeare, facts can be distorted, squeezed, or mixed
with fiction, at times for lack of knowledge, at others for dramaturgic purposes:
In [Henry IV], Hotspur and Harry are of the same age, while in reality the former
could have been the latter’s father. Hotspur was indeed killed at Shrewsbury, but
not at Harry’s hand. Harry’s riotous youth, as presented in [Henry IV], is probably
a myth. As to the feelings and fears of nobles and commoners, for which
historical evidence is scarce, we are free to accept or reject Shakespeare’s
presentation. Whatever its accuracy, it is ingeniously invented.

### Hotspur
Hotspur amassed diplomatic and military honours at a young age: he was sent to
Cyprus (1393), appointed Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine (1394), and took
part in Richard II's expedition to Ireland (1395). At Homildon Hill in
Northumberland (1402), Hotspur and his father, the 1st earl of Northumberland,
inflicted a crushing defeat on the Scots under Archibald Douglas, who was
captured with many of his nobles. Hotspur died in the Battle of Shrewsbury
(1403), five years before his father’s death in the Battle of Bramham Moor
(1408), which ended the Percy Rebellion. The 2nd earl of Northumberland,
Hotspur’s son, was slain in the First Battle of St. Albans (1455), the 3rd in the
Battle of Towton (1461), the 4th during the Yorkshire rebellion (1489), and the 5th
was the first to die in his bed (1527). The fate of the Percys was not uncommon:
the first Stuart to pass away peacefully was James V, the father of Mary Stuart
(1542). Being king or noble tended to be less deadly after 1500 or so, statistically
at least. But I am digressing.

Hotspur appears in seven scenes of [1 Henry IV]: He refuses to render his
prisoner Archibald Douglas and to waive the expected ransom [1.3], decides to
go to war against the King [2.4], plots with Glendower, Worcester, and Mortimer
how to divide England among themselves after the victory. This latter meeting
happened historically in February 1405, only after Shrewsbury. Hotspur and his
fellow rebels prepare for the battle in their base camp [4.1, 4.3], and in [5.1], we
watch the final showdown with Hotspur killed and Harry victorious.

Harry and Hotspur are frequently compared to each other, not always to Harry’s
pleasure. Harry famously mocks his rival: I am not yet of Percy’s mind, the
Hotspur of the north, that kills me some six or seven Scots at breakfast, washes
his hands, and says to his wife, ‘Fie upon this quiet life, I want work’. [1 Henry IV,
2.4, 99]. He not only mocks him but feels superior: Percy is but my factor, good
my lord, to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf [1 Henry IV, 3.2, 147 – 148]. In
the famous dressing-down scene [1 Henry IV, 3.2], Henry IV presents a different
view: While considering his wayward son the punishment for his own misdeeds,
he is most impressed by Hotspur’s feats: He does fill fields with harness in the
realm, turns head against the lion’s armèd jaws, and, being no more in debt to
years than thou, leads ancient lords and revered bishops on to bloody battles and
to bruising arms [101 –105]. Harry, who tries twice in vain to interrupt his
father’s diatribe [18 – 28, 91 – 92], finally manages to convince him of his
conversion.

### Harry
When Henry Bolingbroke, Harry’s father, was exiled (1398), Harry became King
Richard’s page and accompanied him in 1399 on the King’s last journey to Ireland
which opened the way for Bolingbroke’s usurpation (1399). In 1403, Harry, at
only sixteen, led his own army into Wales against Glendower, then joined his
father and commanded the left wing of the Royal Army in the Battle of
Shrewsbury. He was almost killed by an arrow that struck him in the face and left
him scarred for the rest of his life. The battle was won, but at a price. It was
carnage; many did not know which side had won. Despite his military
competence, Harry was discharged from the Council in 1411. According to Dan
Jones, this was due to tensions between the ailing King (he died in 1413) and the
heir, burning for action. The reference in [1 Henry IV, 3.2, 32 – 33] is unhistorical,
because Henry IV presented his accusations while Hotspur was still alive, that is
before 1403. 

On his accession (1413), Henry V wanted to unite England, assert
the pending claim to the French throne, and go on a crusade. He was successful
in the first two aims but failed in the third. Henry quelled the Southampton plot,
immediately before leaving for Harfleur. He embarked on a war with France in
1415, resulting in the victory at Agincourt and the almost unconditional French
surrender: The treaty of Troyes recognized Henry as heir apparent to the French
throne. In 1420, Henry married Charles’s daughter Catherine of Valois. But Henry
died in 1422, bequeathing his infant son an empire too large and heterogeneous
to be governed by a single king, let alone a weak one like Henry VI.

Shakespeare tells us in [1 Henry IV, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4] that Harry spent a great deal
of time in the taverns of Eastcheap, together with his cronies Falstaff, Poins,
Bardolph and others. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can
call them all by their Cristian names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. … And when I am
king of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. [1 Henry IV, 2.4,
10] But Harry’s record of involvement in war and politics disproves Shakespeare’s
account of his lewd behaviour. In his famous soliloquy (I know you all, [1 Henry
IV, 1.2 170]), he gives an odd explanation of his strange behaviour: I’ll so offend
to make offense a skill, redeeming time when men least think I will. As
[Sutherland & Watts, p. 120] point out, first to defile oneself with pitch is an odd
way of making eventual cleanliness seem impressive. But Harry can be cold and
inexorable: He breaks with the past on his accession and severs the links to his
former friends. At the Battle of Agincourt, he has his former companion Bardolph
hanged for looting: We would have all these offenders so cut off [Henry V, 3.6
96].

### Hotspur and Harry
Hotspur died in battle at 39, after having won several wars against the Scots, but
before he could rise to more than local importance. Shakespeare tells us little
about his feelings. Hotspur comes across as a bit of a caricature, the prototype of
the frightening, furious, awe-inspiring medieval warrior devoid of long-term,
strategic thinking. Had he won at Shrewsbury, he might have become king, a
different Henry V, as Henry IV alludes to when comparing his own rivalry with
Richard to that of Hotspur with Harry: As thou art to this hour was Richard then
when I from France set foot at. [1 Henry IV, 3.2, 94 – 95]. Would he have been as
successful as Harry? I doubt it.

Harry died in his bed at 36, after having quelled two rebellions (the Lollards and
the Southampton Plot), united England and subdued most of France. He had
risen to European importance. As a king and, after all, an ordinary mortal, he was
fraught with qualms: his dubious claim to the English throne given his father’s
usurpation, his even more dubious claim to the French throne given the
equivocal Salic law, his envy of commoners, his rights and responsibility as a
military commander, his contrition for misdeeds in war and peace, his desire for
absolution by means of a crusade – these were Henry V’s trials and tribulations
which, if Shakespeare is right, tormented him throughout his career, but that is
another story, told in [Henry V].
