# Newtonian Physics

### Aristotle and Newton

In Newtonian physics, acceleration is proportional to force.
In Aristotelian physics, velocity is proportional to force.

So, there are more than one physics competing. We have kept Newtonian physics because it is useful and works.
It would be perfectly possible to build a consistent, mathematical theory of Aristotelian physics,
but it would be wrong and useless. But Aristotle is much more intuitive than Newton.

### Newton is counterintuitive

Newtonian physics happens in a four-dimensional space that extends straight to infinity in all directions.
This is the stage, and the actors are volumeless particles with position, velocity and mass. 
No one has ever seen anything like this.
It is an abstraction or a model of what we perceive, of what we are used to calling reality.


### Foundations of Newtonian Physics

Here is my message: You can derive all of Newtonian physics from a few quantities and principles using pure mathematics from your armchair.
You would occasionally go back to your lab to verify and challenge your results. 

The base quantities are distance (meter), mass (kilogram), time (second).
They are taken for granted and defined with respect to some natural constants (e.g. wavelength, frequency).
Then you have derived quantities such as velocity, acceleration defined by well-known formulae.

The principles cannot be proven but seem to be reasonable assumptions.

- The principle of relativity, or Galileo invariance, or: you cannot tell which train is moving.
Velocity is always relative, there is no point of absolute rest.
A system with observer A moving at velocity v with respect to observer B is 
undistinguishable from a system with observer B moving at velocity -v with respect to observer A.

- The principle of least action which involves the Lagrangian, a function of position and velocity: $L(x, \dot{x})$,
This principle tells us that particles move in such a way as to minimize the total action, the integral over the Lagrangian.
For each system — pendulum, catenary or otherwise — physicists have found a Lagrangian that describes it.
The plain-vanilla Lagrangian that gets us a long way is the difference between 
kinetic and potential energy: $L(x, \dot{x}) = T(\dot{x}) - V(x)$.

### How Newtonian Physics unfolds
The Euler–Lagrange equation is one of the most important in all of physics. It can be derived from 
the principle of least action by just one application of integration by parts.

$\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}}$ = $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}$

Using the identities

$F = \partial L/\partial x$ (force),

$P = \partial L/\partial \dot{x}$ (momentum),

Euler-Lagrange boils down to

$\dot{P} = F$, 

and the Lagrangian is linked to something we can measure, force and momentum.
You get the Lagrangian from these and vice versa.

Now, this is how physics (not only Newtonian) unfolds: As you plug in suitable Lagrangians, all (or nearly all) of Newtonian physics pop up,
from the simple $F = \dot{P}$ to Navier-Stokes.
