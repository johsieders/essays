## Historical Periods and Key Figures


### Early Middle Ages (500-1000)
- **Boethius** (480-524): Bridge between antiquity and medieval thought
  - Translated Aristotle's logic
  - *Consolation of Philosophy*: fortune's wheel, true happiness in God, eternal providence
  - Created philosophical vocabulary for Latin West
  
- **Johannes Scotus Eriugena** (810-877): Outstanding philosopher of early medieval period

- **Anselm of Canterbury** (1033-1109): Transition to High Middle Ages
  - Ontological argument for God's existence
  - "Fides quaerens intellectum" (faith seeking understanding)
  - Strong realist on universals

### High Middle Ages (1100-1300)
- **Peter Abelard** (1079-1142): Conceptualist position on universals; *Sic et Non* method
- **Albertus Magnus** (ca. 1200-1280): Dominican, Aristotelian scholar
- **Thomas Aquinas** (1225-1274): Dominican, greatest scholastic synthesizer
- **Bonaventura** (1221-1274): Franciscan, mystical-Augustinian approach

### Late Middle Ages (1300-1500)
- **Duns Scotus** (1266-1308): Franciscan, "haecceitas" (thisness)
- **William of Ockham** (ca. 1287-1347): Nominalist, radical separation of faith and reason
- **Roger Bacon** (ca. 1214-1292): Empirical method pioneer

## Major Philosophical Controversies

### 1. Universals: Realism vs. Nominalism

**Realists** (Plato → Anselm → Aquinas):
- Universals exist independently or in things
- Anselm: Without real universals, knowledge impossible
- Aquinas (moderate): Universals exist *ante res* (in God), *in rebus* (in things), *post res* (in minds)
- Scotus: Real common natures + individual "haecceitas"

**Nominalists** (Roscelin → Abelard → Ockham):
- Only individuals exist; universals are names/concepts
- Abelard: Conceptualist middle position
- Ockham: Most radical - universals are mental signs; don't multiply entities (Ockham's Razor)

**Arguments**:
- *Realists*: Science needs universals; language requires them; explains similarity
- *Nominalists*: We only experience particulars; universals create paradoxes; unnecessary (Razor)

**Modern Science**: Largely nominalistic in method (no Platonic forms), though scientists often have realist intuitions about natural kinds and mathematical structures.

### 2. Faith and Reason

**Strong Integration**:
- **Anselm**: Faith first, but reason can demonstrate truths
- **Aquinas**: Natural theology can prove God exists; revealed theology (Trinity, Incarnation) requires faith but isn't contradictory to reason
- Reason and faith harmonize; official Catholic position

**Growing Separation**:
- **Duns Scotus**: More skeptical about what reason can prove
- **Ockham**: Almost nothing theological can be rationally proven; radical fideism
- **Averroists**: "Double truth" - something can be true in philosophy but false in theology (condemned 1277)

**Key Flashpoints**:
- Can God's existence be proven? (Aquinas: yes; Ockham: no)
- Is the soul immortal? (Aquinas: provable; Ockham: faith alone)
- Is the world eternal? (Aristotle: yes; Faith: created in time; Aquinas: logically could be eternal)

**Trajectory**: Early optimism (Anselm) → sophisticated synthesis (Aquinas) → growing skepticism (Ockham) → enabled modern science by separating natural investigation from theology

**Modern Connection**: Science accepted Ockham's methodological separation but dropped the "faith" side. Science confines itself to the perceivable; what's "behind the veil" is not its business.

### 3. The Nature of God's Knowledge and Power

**(a) Divine Omnipotence**:
- **Aquinas**: God can do anything logically possible (not square circles)
- **Ockham/Scotus**: Radical voluntarism - God's will nearly unlimited; could have made murder good
- Stakes: Is natural law contingent? Is morality arbitrary?

**(b) Foreknowledge vs. Free Will**:
- **Problem**: If God knows future, how are we free?
- **Boethius/Aquinas**: God exists outside time in eternal present; doesn't *fore*know, knows all simultaneously
- **Ockham**: Perhaps insoluble; accept both on faith

**(c) Future Contingents**:
- Does God know events that might/might not happen?
- **Aquinas**: Yes, in His eternal now
- **Ockham**: Yes, but we can't explain how

**(d) God's Eternity**:
- **Timeless** (Boethius, Aquinas): God utterly outside time; "eternal now"
- **Temporal** (some Franciscans): God experiences time; more dynamic view

**(e) Divine Simplicity**:
- **Aquinas**: God has no parts; essence = existence = knowledge = power
- **Scotus**: Too extreme; need "formal distinctions" between attributes
- **Ockham**: Our language about God inadequate anyway

**Historical Importance**: While empirically irrelevant, these debates created intellectual space for autonomous natural philosophy.

**Personal Note**: These questions are historically interesting but absolutely irrelevant for understanding science. Boethian "timeless eternity" is a beautiful idea that doesn't explain anything - just relabels the problem.

## Dominicans vs. Franciscans

**Franciscans** (founded 1209 by Francis of Assisi):
- Radical poverty, humility, mysticism
- Emotional/mystical approach to faith
- Philosophically: Augustinian, primat of will, skeptical of pure reason
- Key figures: Bonaventura, Duns Scotus, Ockham

**Dominicans** (founded 1216 by Dominikus):
- Intellectual mission: study and preaching
- Combat heresy through rational argumentation
- Philosophically: Aristotelian-Thomistic, primat of intellect, synthesis of faith and reason
- Key figures: Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas

## Key Takeaways

1. Medieval philosophy was NOT monolithic dogmatism - intense, creative debates within theological constraints
2. The nominalist/realist debate affected nearly all other philosophical questions
3. The trajectory from Anselm's optimism through Aquinas' synthesis to Ockham's separation enabled modern science
4. Medieval theological debates are historically important but don't illuminate how nature actually works
5. Modern science is methodologically nominalist and operates within Ockham's separation of domains
